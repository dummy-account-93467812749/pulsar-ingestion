# Partial Completion Report: Vehicle Telemetry CMF Refactor

## 1. Goal

The primary goal of this initiative is to refactor the data ingestion pipeline to use a new, detailed Common Message Format (CMF) specifically designed for vehicle telemetry data. This involves:
*   Defining a comprehensive CMF structure that includes rich telemetry and event data as specified in the project issue.
*   Creating new Pulsar translator functions to convert various source-specific message formats into this new CMF.
*   Updating unit tests, integration tests, deployment configurations, and documentation to reflect these changes.
*   Ensuring the new CMF is processed correctly by downstream components like the filterer.

## 2. Outlined Steps (Original Plan Summary)

The original plan consisted of the following high-level steps:
1.  **Define New CMF Data Structures**: Create Kotlin classes for `CommonMessageFormat<T>`, `SourceType`, `CommonTelemetry`, `CommonEvents`, etc.
2.  **Create New Vehicle Telemetry Translators**: Develop new Pulsar functions (e.g., for Geotab, CalAmp, Ford) that convert "invented" source formats to the new CMF.
3.  **Write Unit Tests for New Translators**: Ensure each new translator functions correctly.
4.  **Update `settings.gradle.kts`**: Include the new translator module(s) in the build.
5.  **Update `deployment/pipeline.yaml`**: Configure the new translators, their input/output topics, and update the filterer's input.
6.  **Update Integration Tests**: Modify integration tests to validate the end-to-end flow with the new CMF.
7.  **Update `deployment/compose/scripts/load_test.py`**: Adapt the load testing script to use the new message formats.
8.  **Update Documentation**: Reflect changes in `docs/architecture.md` and other relevant documents.
9.  **Refactor/Remove Old Components**: Deprecate or remove old CMF structures and translators if superseded.
10. **Submit Changes**: Commit the completed work.

## 3. Precisely What Has Been Done and How

As of the last `submit` operation (branch: `feature/vehicle-telemetry-cmf`), the following steps have been completed:

### Step 1: Define New CMF Data Structures
*   **Action**: Created a new Kotlin file: `libs/src/main/kotlin/com/example/pulsar/common/CommonMessageFormat.kt`.
*   **Details**: This file now contains the complete definition of the new CMF as per the issue statement. This includes:
    *   `CommonMessageFormat<T>` (generic data class)
    *   `SourceType` (enum)
    *   `CommonTelemetry` (data class with numerous optional telemetry fields)
    *   `CommonEvents` (data class with lists of various event types like DTCs, hard braking, etc.)
    *   All associated nested data classes (`CommonLocation`, `CommonDtcEvent`, etc.) and enums (`IgnitionStatus`, `EVPlugStatus`, etc.).
    *   Optional fields are correctly marked as nullable with default `null` values.

### Step 2: Create New Vehicle Telemetry Translators
*   **Action**: Created a new directory structure for the translators: `pulsar-components/cmf/vehicle-telemetry-translators/src/main/kotlin/com/example/pulsar/functions/cmf/translators/`.
*   **Details**: Implemented three new translator functions:
    *   `GeotabTranslator.kt`:
        *   Defines an "invented" `GeotabInputMessage` data class with fields like `Device_ID`, `Record_DateTime`, `Latitude`, `Odometer_mi`, etc.
        *   Translates this input into `CommonMessageFormat`, setting `sourceType` to `Geotab`.
        *   Populates `CommonTelemetry` from the input.
        *   Includes example `sourceSpecificData`.
    *   `CalAmpTranslator.kt`:
        *   Defines an "invented" `CalAmpInputMessage` data class with fields like `unit_id`, `msg_ts` (epoch seconds), `gps_lat`, `fuel_percent`, etc.
        *   Translates to `CommonMessageFormat`, setting `sourceType` to `CalAmp`.
    *   `FordTranslator.kt`:
        *   Defines an "invented" `FordInputMessage` data class with fields like `vin`, `esn`, `captureTime` (epoch ms), nested `FordCoordinates`, etc.
        *   Translates to `CommonMessageFormat`, setting `sourceType` to `Ford`.
    *   All translators use `jacksonObjectMapper` for JSON processing and include basic logging.

### Step 3: Write Unit Tests for New Translators
*   **Action**: Created a new test directory: `pulsar-components/cmf/vehicle-telemetry-translators/src/test/kotlin/com/example/pulsar/functions/cmf/translators/`.
*   **Details**: Added corresponding JUnit 5 unit test files for each translator:
    *   `GeotabTranslatorTest.kt`
    *   `CalAmpTranslatorTest.kt`
    *   `FordTranslatorTest.kt`
    *   Each test suite uses Mockito to mock Pulsar's `Context` and `Logger`.
    *   Tests cover:
        *   Processing of valid input JSON, verifying correct mapping to CMF fields (vehicleId, deviceId, sourceType, epochSource, dateTime, telemetry fields, sourceSpecificData, meta).
        *   Handling of inputs with missing optional fields (verifying nulls or default enum values).
        *   Behavior with malformed input JSON (expecting null output and error logging).
        *   Correct `tenantId` and `partitionKey` propagation (using examples).

### Step 4: Update `settings.gradle.kts`
*   **Action**: Modified the root `settings.gradle.kts` file.
*   **Details**: Added the new module path `"pulsar-components:cmf:vehicle-telemetry-translators"` to the `include(...)` block, grouping it with other `pulsar-components:cmf:*` modules. This makes Gradle aware of the new module containing the translators.

### Step 5: Update `deployment/pipeline.yaml`
*   **Action**: Modified the Pulsar pipeline deployment configuration file `deployment/pipeline.yaml`.
*   **Details**:
    *   Added new function configurations for:
        *   `geotab-translator` (className: `com.example.pulsar.functions.cmf.translators.GeotabTranslator`)
            *   Input: `raw-kinesis-events`
        *   `calamp-translator` (className: `com.example.pulsar.functions.cmf.translators.CalAmpTranslator`)
            *   Input: `raw-kafka-events`
        *   `ford-translator` (className: `com.example.pulsar.functions.cmf.translators.FordTranslator`)
            *   Input: `raw-http-events`
    *   All new translators use the image `ghcr.io/acme/translators:0.1.0` (pending confirmation this image will contain the new code or if a new build/tag is needed).
    *   Set the `output` topic for all three new translators to a new common topic: `persistent://acme/ingest/vehicle-telemetry-common-format`.
    *   Updated the existing `event-type-splitter` function's `input` to consume from `persistent://acme/ingest/vehicle-telemetry-common-format`.

## 4. Precisely What Is Left (Remaining Plan Steps)

The following steps from the original plan are yet to be completed:

### Step 6: Update Integration Tests
*   **Current Status**: This is the step I was actively working on before the last submission. I was attempting to locate the existing integration test files.
*   **To-Do**:
    *   Identify the correct path and files for integration tests (likely within `pulsar-components/cmf/translators-integration/`).
    *   Modify existing tests or create new ones to:
        *   Send test messages using the "invented" Geotab, CalAmp, and Ford input formats to their respective raw input topics as configured in `pipeline.yaml`.
        *   Consume messages from the new `persistent://acme/ingest/vehicle-telemetry-common-format` topic.
        *   Add assertions to validate that the consumed messages are correctly transformed into the new `CommonMessageFormat`, verifying structure, data integrity, and metadata.
    *   This will likely involve understanding the existing integration testing framework, how Pulsar services are started/mocked, and how topics are managed in the test environment.

### Step 7: Update `deployment/compose/scripts/load_test.py`
*   **To-Do**:
    *   Modify the Python-based load testing script (`deployment/compose/scripts/load_test.py`).
    *   Update its payload generation logic to create messages conforming to one or more of the new "invented" source-specific input formats (e.g., the Geotab format).
    *   Ensure the script sends these new payloads to the correct Pulsar input topic that is now routed to one of the new translators (e.g., `raw-kinesis-events` for Geotab).
    *   Verify the script runs and correctly simulates load with the new message structure.

### Step 8: Update Documentation
*   **To-Do**:
    *   **`docs/architecture.md`**: Update this document to describe the new CMF, the role of the new vehicle telemetry translators, the updated data flow (including new topics), and how it differs from or replaces previous data formats for telemetry.
    *   **KDocs**: Add comprehensive KDoc comments to all new data classes in `CommonMessageFormat.kt` and to the new translator classes (`GeotabTranslator.kt`, etc.), explaining fields, purpose, and the "invented" input formats they expect. (Basic KDocs were included in the translators, but these should be reviewed and expanded).
    *   **READMEs**: Review and update any README files within `pulsar-components/cmf/` or other relevant directories if they describe the old CMF or data transformation processes that have now changed for vehicle telemetry.
    *   This new `PARTIAL_WORK_DONE_CMF_REFACTOR.md` file serves as interim documentation.

### Step 9: Refactor/Remove Old Components
*   **To-Do**:
    *   Carefully analyze if the old generic `CommonEvent.kt` (in `libs/src/main/kotlin/com/example/pulsar/libs/`) and the old translators (e.g., `InventoryUpdateTranslator`, `OrderRecordTranslator`, etc., located in `pulsar-components/cmf/`) are still required for any other data ingestion pipelines or if their functionality related to vehicle telemetry is entirely superseded by the new CMF and translators.
    *   If they are superseded for telemetry:
        *   Remove their source files.
        *   Remove their corresponding unit test files.
        *   Remove their configurations from `settings.gradle.kts` (if they were separate modules).
        *   Remove their configurations from `deployment/pipeline.yaml`.
    *   This step requires caution and confirmation that these components are not used by other parts of the system. The current work has focused on *adding* new functionality alongside existing ones, rather than immediate replacement.

### Step 10: Submit Final Changes
*   **To-Do**: After all above steps are completed and verified:
    *   Run all unit and integration tests to ensure they pass.
    *   Perform any necessary manual testing or validation.
    *   Commit the final set of changes with a comprehensive commit message.

This provides a detailed account of the project's status.
