This file acts as a wrapper to render the _bootstrap.sh.tpl template.
_bootstrap.sh.tpl is prefixed with an underscore to prevent Helm from
trying to parse it as a primary chart template during its initial scan,
which was causing a "SimpleHead" parsing error due to its shell script content.
Underscore-prefixed templates are treated as helpers and are not directly
rendered by "helm template --show-only" unless included by a non-underscored template.
