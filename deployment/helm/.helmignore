# Previous content related to a different issue:
# # Ignore the bootstrap script template from initial Helm parsing,
# # but allow it to be targeted by "helm template --show-only"
# !templates/compose/bootstrap.sh.tpl
# # Actually, the above is wrong. .helmignore prevents files from being packaged.
# # To prevent the "SimpleHead" error, the issue is that Helm is trying to parse it
# # when it shouldn't.
# # Let's try ignoring all .sh.tpl files from being parsed as main templates,
# # if that's even possible, or specific paths.
# # The goal is to stop Helm from trying to interpret its content as chart metadata.
# 
# # For now, let's try explicitly ignoring the problematic file if it's found during the initial scan.
# # If Helm is trying to parse it as a primary template or chart:
# # templates/compose/bootstrap.sh.tpl
# 
# # A common use is to ignore non-template files:
# *.bak
# *.swp
# 
# # If the issue is that Helm is trying to parse it *at all* when scanning `templates/`
# # then the underscore prefix was the right approach for *that* problem.
# # The new problem ("could not find template") arose because underscore files are not directly renderable.
# 
# # The .helmignore file is for preventing files from being included in the packaged chart.
# # It does not prevent Helm from trying to parse files in the templates/ directory during `helm template` or `helm lint`.
# # The "SimpleHead" error means Helm *is* parsing it and failing.
# # So, .helmignore is not the right tool for *this specific parsing error*.
# 
# # The underscore prefix (`_bootstrap.sh.tpl`) correctly made Helm's initial parser ignore it.
# # The subsequent error `Error: could not find template templates/compose/_bootstrap.sh.tpl in chart`
# # is because `--show-only` cannot render underscore-prefixed files directly as they are considered helpers.
# 
# # The solution is to make `_bootstrap.sh.tpl` a helper, and then have a tiny, non-underscored
# # file that *includes* `_bootstrap.sh.tpl`.
# 
# # Let's clear this .helmignore as it's not the right solution path.
# # Instead, I will pursue the "wrapper template" approach.
# # (Content of .helmignore will be empty for now, or just comments)
# # ---
# # This file is intentionally left blank or with comments only.
# # The previous strategy of using .helmignore for the "SimpleHead" parsing issue
# # was incorrect. The underscore prefix for the template file was the correct
# # way to stop Helm from parsing it as a primary chart file.
# # The subsequent issue of not being able to render an underscore-prefixed template
# # needs to be solved by using a non-underscored wrapper template that includes it.
